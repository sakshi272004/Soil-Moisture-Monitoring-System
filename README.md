Soil Moisture Monitoring System

The project is a Smart Soil Moisture Monitoring System designed to detect soil moisture levels and enable automated irrigation.
It uses an Arduino microcontroller in combination with a soil moisture sensor to monitor the soil's moisture content.
The system transmits the moisture data wirelessly using the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module.
The project utilizes the ESPAsyncWebServer library to display real-time moisture readings on a web interface.
Adafruit_Sensor library is used to handle the sensor data and ensure accurate moisture measurements.
This IoT-based solution helps optimize water usage, making it suitable for agricultural and gardening applications.
The project demonstrates skills in sensor integration, wireless communication, and web development for real-time monitoring.
