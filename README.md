Soil Moisture Monitoring System
This project implements a Smart Soil Moisture Monitoring System using an Arduino microcontroller and a soil moisture sensor. The system detects soil moisture levels and transmits the data wirelessly through the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. A web interface, powered by ESPAsyncWebServer and Adafruit_Sensor, displays real-time moisture readings. This IoT-based solution can be used for automated irrigation, optimizing water usage in agricultural or gardening applications. The project demonstrates sensor interfacing, Wi-Fi communication, and web development, making it a scalable and efficient tool for soil condition monitoring.
